## Output Artifacts

This analysis step will produce:
- ✅ This requirements document
- 📋 List of functional requirements (prioritized)
- 🎯 Success criteria and acceptance tests
- ⚠️ Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to the design step, verify:

- [ ] All functional requirements are clearly defined and prioritized
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and achievable
- [ ] Constraints and assumptions are documented
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained (if required)
- [ ] At least [3] functional requirements identified
- [ ] All required sections are complete

## Next Step

After validation passes, proceed to **Design (Step 2)** with this requirements document as input.
